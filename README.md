# number-pi

# About The Project
Script provides some basic information about the number π, a few ways of calculating it and visualization of the convergence of the series used to calculate π.

# Built With
Python 3.9.10

# Getting started

### Working with number-pi:
1. Run the script.
2. Script should print basic information about the number π and its calculated value in the terminal.
3. Script should also open a window with convergence of the series.

# Usage
